**Canvas Transformations Demo (Jetpack Compose)**

This Android app demonstrates drawing shapes, paths, and images using Jetpack Compose’s Canvas, and applying transformations (scale, rotate, translate) to them collectively.

Users can control the transformations interactively with sliders.

** Features**

Draw basic shapes:

1]  Circle

 2] Rounded Rectangle

 3] Line

 4] Triangle (Path)


**Apply transformations to all shapes at once:**

 Scale (zoom in/out)

 Rotate (0°–360°)

 Translate (move on X/Y axis)

Sliders let you experiment in real-time.
